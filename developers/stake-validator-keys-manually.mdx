## Staking with registry

[Validator Registry Contract](http://explorer.testnet.mev-commit.xyz/address/0xF263483500e849Bd8d452c9A0F075B606ee64087)

The validator registry contract is deployed to the mev-commit chain at address `0xF263483500e849Bd8d452c9A0F075B606ee64087`, with a minimum stake requirement of 3 ETH, and a 7000 block unstaking period. This unstaking period corresponds to 23.3 minutes, assuming a 200ms mev-commit chain block time. This period allows two L1 epochs (L1 finalization period) plus a settlement buffer, to pass between validator unstake initiation and withdrawal.

The registry strictly accepts BLS public keys as the validator opt-in identifier. Any EOA can stake on behalf of a validator pub key, and only that EOA has the ability to withdraw in the future.

To stake with the mev-commit validator registry, first use the [testnet faucet](/get-started/faucet) to fund an account on the mev-commit chain.

To `stake` with the contract, see the following function signature, where ether sent with the transaction is split evenly among the specified validator pub keys:

```solidity
function stake(bytes[] calldata validatorBLSPubKeys) external payable {
    uint256 splitAmount = msg.value / validatorBLSPubKeys.length;
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < validatorBLSPubKeys.length; i++) {
        stakedBalances[validatorBLSPubKeys[i]] += splitAmount;
    }
}
```

Note the `stake` function accepts multiple validator BLS pub keys. There are inherent gas limitations to the number of validators that can be staked in a single transaction, it's recommended to stake in batches of 10-20 pub keys at a time.

### Golang example

We're working on a UI to stake with the validator registry. In the meantime you can programmatically interact with the registry via [golang scripts](https://github.com/primev/validator-registry).

For example, to stake any number of validator BLS public keys with the registry, use [this example script](https://github.com/primev/validator-registry/blob/main/cmd/stake/main.go) as described below.

First clone the validator-registry repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/primev/validator-registry.git
```

Then cd into the repo and populate `keys_example.txt` with your validator BLS public keys.

```bash
cd validator-registry
vi keys_example.txt
*Edit file as needed*
```

Then navigate to the `cmd/stake` directory and run the script with the private key that was funded above.

```bash
cd cmd/stake
PRIVATE_KEY="0x..." go run main.go
```

Note this script will attempt to stake 3.1 ETH on behalf of each validator BLS public key in `keys_example.txt`.

## Withdrawing staked ether

If you wish to withdraw your staked ether, you can do so via the previously mentioned validator registry page, or using a golang script similar to what's provided. Note an unstaking period is enforced, meaning you must first submit an `unstake` transaction, wait an appropriate amount of blocks, then submit a `withdraw` transaction, transferring funds to your account.
