**To Check Your Deposit Allowance:**

  ```shell
  > curl localhost:13523/v1/bidder/get_allowance | jq
  {
    "amount": "0"
  }
  ```

**Funding Your Node Account:**
  First, retrieve the Ethereum account address of your node:

    ```shell
    > curl localhost:13523/topology | jq
    {
      "self": {
        "Addresses": [
          "/ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/13522",
          "/ip4/172.29.0.4/tcp/13522"
        ],
        "Ethereum Address": "0xB9286CB4782E43A202BfD426AbB72c8cb34f886c",
        "Peer Type": "bidder",
        "Underlay": "16Uiu2HAmDWZb4DxZQkS9yseXNukBFe6MhZdimSKuZcHFeJrF3jC9"
      },
      "connected_peers": {
        "providers": [
          "0x48ddc642514370bdafad81c91e23759b0302c915",
          "0x972eb4fc3c457da4c957306be7fa1976bb8f39a6",
          "0xa1e8fdb3bb6a0db7aa5db49a3512b01671686dcb"
        ]
      },
      "blocked_peers": null
    }
    ```

To add funds to your account on the mev-commit chain, you may use the [testnet faucet](http://faucet.testnet.mev-commit.xyz/). 


- **Checking Minimum Deposit Allowance:**

Providers will only accept bids from bidders with funds exceeding the minimum allowance. The amount is in `wei`. To check this amount:

```shell
> curl localhost:13523/v1/bidder/get_min_allowance | jq
{
  "amount": "1000000000000000000"
}
```

- **Adding to Your Deposit Allowance:**

To increase your deposit allowance, use the following command, specifying the desired amount:

```shell
> curl -X POST localhost/v1/bidder/prepay/YOUR_AMOUNT | jq
```

After successfully adding to your allowance, you are ready to send bids and receive preconfirmations on the network.

### Outcome of Preconfirmed Bids:
When a bid is preconfirmed by a provider, there are several possible outcomes:

| Outcome Matrix | Provider Wins Slot Auction| Provider Loses Slot Auction |
| --------------------- | --------------| --------|
| **Transaction in block**                   | Reward Provider          | Refund Bid to Bidder  |
| **Transaction not in block**                 | Slash Provider & Refund Bid To Bidder           | Refund Bid to Bidder  |
