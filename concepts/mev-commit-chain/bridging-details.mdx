# Understanding Bridging Mechanisms

The mev-commit chain utilizes advanced bridging mechanisms to ensure a secure and efficient transfer of assets between the Ethereum mainnet (L1) and the mev-commit chain. Below is the process and a breakdown.

We envision mev-commit to eventually integrate a multitude of bridges to other chains, using multiple tech stacks
(think wormhole, layerzero, etc.). In the meantime Primev has implemented its own lock/mint bridging protocol as described below.

See [implementation](https://github.com/primev/mev-commit-bridge/tree/main/standard/bridge-v1).

## Lock/Mint Peg

Native ether on the mev-commit chain maintains a 1:1 peg with ether on L1. The only way to mint ether on the mev-commit chain is to lock equivalent ether in a bridge contract on L1. Ether can be burned on the mev-commit chain's bridge contract to release equivalent ether from the L1 bridge contract.

Ether that is used as gas on the mev-commit chain will accumulate in a treasury contract on L1.

## Security 

There are inherent security assumptions in bridging ether to the mev-commit chain. While these are similar to other bridge trust assumptions, we've listed them below:

- Liveness of the mev-commit-bridge relayer actor.
- POA signers that maintain mev-commit chain state.
- Correctness of Primev's [standard bridge protocol](https://github.com/primev/mev-commit-bridge/tree/main/standard/bridge-v1) and integration into the mev-commit chain.

The Primev core team is committed to secure and live bridging.

## **Importance of Origin Chain Security**

**Selective Bridging**: Only bridges originating from Ethereum L1 should be allowed to mint native ether on the mev-commit chain. This is to prevent the impact of compromised states on other chains affecting the mev-commit chain.

## Bridge Contracts

See **Bridge Contracts** section of [contracts page](/developers/contracts) to gain context on contracts necessary to enable bridging.
