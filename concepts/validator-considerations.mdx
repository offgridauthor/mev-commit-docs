## Validator Considerations

### Trust Assumptions

Opting into the mev-commit protocol signals from a validator that they:

* Trust correctness of execution from the mev-commit chain. See [mev-commit chain](/concepts/mev-commit-chain/chain-details) for more information.
* Trust correctness of slashing transactions residing from the Primev operated [mev-commit-oracle](https://github.com/primev/mev-commit/tree/main/oracle) service.
* Trust at least one mev-commit opted in relay. The Titan Holesky relay is the only such relay at this time, see the [Titan Holesky Relay here](https://docs.titanrelay.xyz/).
* Attest they will follow the rules of the protocol given the above trust assumptions. This currently entails *only* proposing blocks that come from a mev-commit opted in relay. 

### Risks

Validators opting into the mev-commit protocol should be aware of the following risks:

* **Relay block delivery:** Relays could communicate blocks that do not abide by existing commitments. This would lead to slashing of the validator.
* **Failure to propose block:** Validators could fail to propose a block for a slot that has preconf commitments. This would lead to slashing of the validator if there are existing commitments

### Future plans & Eigenlayer

Primev is working on improvements to the validator opt-in mechanism to make it more seamless to validators, and enable new preconf use cases. There is active work on a mev-commit Eigenlayer AVS in which operators could serve as mev-commit providers, who act on behalf of validators.
