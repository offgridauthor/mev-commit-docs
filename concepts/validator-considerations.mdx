## Validator considerations

### Trust assumptions

Opting into the mev-commit protocol signals from a validator that they:

* Trust correctness of execution from the mev-commit chain. See [mev-commit chain](concepts/mev-commit-chain/chain-details) for more information.
* Trust correctness of slashing transactions residing from the Primev operated [mev-commit-oracle](https://github.com/primevprotocol/mev-commit-oracle) service.
* Trust at least one mev-commit opted in relay. The Titan Holesky relay is the only such relay at this time, see [URL here](https://docs.titanrelay.xyz/).
* Attest they will follow the rules of the protocol given the above trust assumptions. This currently entails *only* proposing blocks that come from a mev-commit opted in relay. 

### Risks

Validators opting into the mev-commit protocol should be aware of the following risks:

* Relay block delivery: Relays could communicate blocks that do not abide by existing commitments. This would lead to slashing of the validator.
* Failure to propose block: Validators could fail to propose a block for a slot that has preconf commitments. This would lead to slashing of the validator.

### Future plans

Primev is working on improvements to the validator opt-in mechanism to make it more seamless to validators, and enable new preconf use-cases.

One such idea is to introduce an eigenlayer AVS in which operators could serve as mev-commit providers, who act on behalf of validators. Upcoming proposers could then directly commit to preconf bids affecting their block. This new type of direct preconf offers the highest level of credibility to bidders, and offers concrete revenue generation for proposers/operators.
