# Quickstart

Ready to get your node up and running? This streamlined process will guide you through launching either a bidder or provider node on the mev-commit network.


    <CodeGroup>
        ```bash ‚ùØ_ bidder
         curl -L -o launchmevcommit launch.mev-commit.xyz; chmod +x launchmevcommit; ./launchmevcommit --node-type bidder
        ```

        ```bash ‚ùØ_ provider
         curl -L -o launchmevcommit launch.mev-commit.xyz; chmod +x launchmevcommit; ./launchmevcommit --node-type provider
        ```

    ## Script Overview

    This script automates the setup and initialization of your Primev node, catering to both bidder and provider roles. Below is a detailed breakdown of the script's operations:

    ### 1. Initialization
    - Sets up essential variables like the RPC URL (`https://chainrpc.testnet.mev-commit.xyz) for network communication and the node type (either `bidder` or `provider`).
    - Establishes the root directory (`$HOME/.mev-commit`) where the mev-commit node will be installed.

    ### 2. Download
    - Fetches the appropriate mev-commit binary for your system from the [Primev GitHub releases page](https://github.com/primev/mev-commit/releases/latest), considering your operating system and architecture.

    ### 3. Installation
    - Extracts the downloaded binary into the specified root directory, ensuring all necessary executables are correctly placed for the node's operation.

    ### 4. Configuration
    - Initializes the mev-commit node with your specified settings, including the node type and the RPC endpoint, along with necessary contract addresses for the node's functionality.

    ### 5. Wallet Setup
    - Generates a new private key and wallet address for your node and secures it with test ether to facilitate transactions within the testnet environment.

    ### 6. Node Startup
    - Launches the mev-commit node in the background tailored to the specified role, enabling it to begin its operations within the Primev network.

    ### 7. Cleanup
    - Includes a cleanup function to ensure the node is properly shut down when the script exits, preventing any residual processes.

    If you are a Bidder or a Provider, you need to fund your node via the [Testnet Faucet](/get-started/faucet) page.  
      
    OR  
      
    If you have already funded your account:  
      
    Bidders can move on to [My First Preconf](/get-started/bidders/first-preconf) to start sending bids.
    Providers can get started with the [registration process](/get-started/providers/registering-a-provider).
