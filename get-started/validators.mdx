# Introduction

L1 validator participation in the mev-commit protocol is crucial to enforce delivery of preconfs, and add additional credibility to commitments. This guide will walk you through the process of opting-in to the mev-commit protocol as a Holesky validator.

## Querying opted-in validators

Anyone can query whether a validator is opted-in to the mev-commit protocol by calling the `isStaked` function on the [validator registry contract](https://github.com/primevprotocol/contracts/pull/86).

## Determining upcoming opted-in proposers

Due to L1 proposer selection being fixed two epochs in advance, bidders can accurately predict whether the proposer for an upcoming slot will be a mev-commit opted-in validator. To query upcoming proposers from a beacon node, use the [getProposerDuties endpoint](https://ethereum.github.io/beacon-APIs/#/Validator/getProposerDuties). The returned proposer list can be cross-checked with the previously mentioned `isStaked` function to determine if a validator is opted-in to mev-commit.

The mev-commit-oracle will streamline this process by updating a list on the validator registry contract with mev-commit opted-in proposers for the latest two epochs.

# Opting-in as a validator

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

1. An operational Holesky validator node. 
2. An operational mev-boost sidecar.
3. Associated validator keys.

## Requirements

By opting-in to the mev-commit protocol as a Holesky validator, you agree to the following:

* Your mev-boost client will connect ONLY to mev-commit opted in relays. The Titan Holesky relay is the only such relay at this time, see [URL here](https://docs.titanrelay.xyz/).
* 3 ether must be staked with a registry contract on the mev-commit chain for the validator account, see below for further instructions.

## Staking with registry

To stake with the mev-commit validator registry, first use our faucet page to obtain some ether on the mev-commit chain.

_Faucet needs subdomain_

Once you've obtained ether on the mev-commit chain, you can `selfStake` it with the [validator registry contract](https://github.com/primevprotocol/monorepo/blob/40e00bc8f95329423a116077f7b5ef11ac7df3e2/contracts/contracts/ValidatorRegistry.sol). Alteratively, one account can opt-in multiple validators accounts via the registry's `splitStake` method.

_Validator registry contract address TBD_

A frontend UI for the validator registry is in progress. For now, you can programmatically interact with the registry via [forge script](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/forge/forge-script). See [example script](https://github.com/primevprotocol/monorepo/blob/40e00bc8f95329423a116077f7b5ef11ac7df3e2/contracts/scripts/ValidatorExampleScript.s.sol).

Where invocation of said script would look like the following

```bash
forge script "scripts/ValidatorExampleScript.s.sol:StakeAndUnstakeExample" --rpc-url "https://chainrpc.testnet.mev-commit.xyz" --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY --broadcast --chain-id "17864" -vvvv --use 0.8.23 --via-ir
```

## Withdrawing staked ether

If you wish to withdraw your staked ether, you can do so via the previously mentioned validator registry page, or using a forge script. Note an unstaking period is enforced, meaning you must first submit an `unstake` transaction, wait an appropriate amount of blocks, then submit a `withdraw` transaction, transferring funds to your account.
