## Opting-in as a Validator

L1 validator participation in the mev-commit protocol adds ultimate credibility to commitments and enforces their delivery. This guide walks through the process of opting-in to the mev-commit testnet as a Holesky validator. A restaking version will also be enabled in the future through Eigenlayer.

**Prerequisites:**

1. An operational Holesky validator node. 
2. An operational mev-boost sidecar or equivalent.
3. Associated validator key(s).

### Requirements

By opting-in to the mev-commit protocol as a Holesky validator, you agree to the following:

* Your mev-boost client should ONLY connect to mev-commit opted in relays to avoid being slashed by proposing a block that doesn't deliver commitments. The Titan Holesky relay is the only supporting relay at this time as shown in the list below. This list will be updated as more relays support the network.  
  
**Supporting Relays:**  

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th width="350">Relay Name</th>
      <th width="350">Docs Link</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Titan</td>
      <td>[https://docs.titanrelay.xyz/](https://docs.titanrelay.xyz/)</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

If you are a relay looking to join mev-commit network please visit our [Relays page](/get-started/relays) to get more information.
  
* 3 ETH must be staked with the registry contract on the mev-commit chain for the validator account, which you can obtain from our [Testnet Faucet](/get-started/faucet).
