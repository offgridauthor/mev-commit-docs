## Opting-in as a Validator

Participation of L1 validators in the mev-commit protocol is crucial as it enhances the integrity of commitments and ensures their enforcement. This document details the steps required to join the mev-commit testnet as a Holesky validator. Future updates will introduce a restaking feature via Eigenlayer.

**Prerequisites:**

1. An operational Holesky validator node. 
2. An operational mev-boost sidecar or equivalent.
3. Associated validator key(s).

<Warning>As a Holesky validator opting into the mev-commit protocol, ensure your mev-boost client connects only to mev-commit relays to avoid slashing for proposing blocks without delivering commitments.</Warning>

## Staking

|                      |                                          |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Contract             | [0xF263483500e849Bd8d452c9A0F075B606ee64087](http://explorer.testnet.mev-commit.xyz/address/0xF263483500e849Bd8d452c9A0F075B606ee64087) |

The validator registry contract is deployed on the mev-commit chain at the address `0xF263483500e849Bd8d452c9A0F075B606ee64087`. 
It requires a minimum stake of `3 ETH` and enforces a `7000` block unstaking period. This period, which translates to approximately `23.3` minutes 
assuming a `200ms` block time on the mev-commit chain, is designed to cover two L1 epochs (L1 finalization period) plus a settlement buffer. 
This ensures a safe transition period between the initiation of an unstake and the actual withdrawal.

The registry exclusively uses BLS public keys as identifiers for validator opt-in. Any externally owned account (EOA) can stake on behalf 
of a validator's public key, but only the staking EOA can initiate withdrawals in the future.

To begin staking, first obtain funds from the [testnet faucet](/get-started/faucet) to use on the mev-commit chain.

The `stake` function in the contract allows for multiple validator BLS public keys to be staked in one transaction.
Ether sent with the transaction is evenly distributed among the provided validator public keys:

```solidity
function stake(bytes[] calldata validatorBLSPubKeys) external payable {
    uint256 splitAmount = msg.value / validatorBLSPubKeys.length;
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < validatorBLSPubKeys.length; i++) {
        stakedBalances[validatorBLSPubKeys[i]] += splitAmount;
    }
}
```

<Note> Due to gas limitations, it is recommended to stake in batches of 10-20 public keys at a time to ensure transaction success without hitting gas limits. </Note>

### Validator Dashboard

We have developed a comprehensive Validator Dashboard UI that allows validators to easily manage their stakes.
This user-friendly interface provides functionalities to stake new validator BLS public keys, unstake keys,
and withdraw staked keys. Additionally, validators can track their rewards directly through the dashboard.
This tool is designed to simplify the management of your commitments and rewards on the mev-commit chain.

For access and more detailed instructions on how to use the Validator Dashboard, please visit the following link: [Validator Dashboard](/validator-dashboard).

<Info>
  The Validator Dashboard is an essential tool for anyone participating as a validator on the mev-commit chain.
  It not only simplifies the staking and unstaking process but also provides real-time insights into your staking rewards.

### Using Golang
You can programmatically interact with the validator registry using [Golang scripts](https://github.com/primev/validator-registry). 
To stake one or more validator BLS public keys, refer to [this example script](https://github.com/primev/validator-registry/blob/main/cmd/stake/main.go) as outlined in the steps below:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Clone the Repository">
    Clone the validator-registry repository using the following command:
    ```bash ❯_ terminal
    git clone https://github.com/primev/validator-registry.git
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Prepare Validator Keys">
    Change directory into the cloned repository and edit the `keys_example.txt` file to include your validator BLS public keys:
    ```bash ❯_ terminal
    cd validator-registry
    vi keys_example.txt
    *Edit file as needed*
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run the Stake Script">
    Navigate to the `cmd/stake` directory and run the staking script with your funded private key:
    ```bash ❯_ terminal
    cd cmd/stake
    PRIVATE_KEY="0x..." go run main.go
    ```
    This script will attempt to stake `3.1` ETH on behalf of each validator BLS public key in `keys_example.txt`.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Withdrawing

To withdraw your staked ether, you have two options: through the validator registry interface or programmatically using a Golang script.
Please be aware that an unstaking period is mandatory. You must initiate an `unstake` transaction and wait for the required number of
blocks to pass before you can execute a `withdraw` transaction to transfer the funds to your account.
