### Opting-in as a Validator

L1 validator participation in the mev-commit protocol adds ultimate credibility to commitments and enforces their delivery. This guide walks through the process of opting-in to the mev-commit testnet as a Holesky validator. A restaking version will also be enabled in the future through Eigenlayer.

**Prerequisites:**

1. An operational Holesky validator node. 
2. An operational mev-boost sidecar or equivalent.
3. Associated validator key(s).

## Requirements

By opting-in to the mev-commit protocol as a Holesky validator, you agree to the following:

* Your mev-boost client should ONLY connect to mev-commit opted in relays to avoid being slashed by proposing a block that doesn't deliver commitments. The Titan Holesky relay is the only such relay at this time, see [the Titan Holesky Relay](https://docs.titanrelay.xyz/).
* 3 ETH must be staked with the registry contract on the mev-commit chain for the validator account, which you can obtain from our [Faucet](/get-started/faucet).

## Staking with registry

To stake with the mev-commit validator registry, first use the [testnet faucet](/get-started/faucet) to fund an account on the mev-commit chain.

Once you've obtained ether on the mev-commit chain, you can stake it with the [validator registry contract](http://explorer.testnet.mev-commit.xyz/address/0xF263483500e849Bd8d452c9A0F075B606ee64087). The validator registry contract is deployed to the mev-commit chain at address `0xF263483500e849Bd8d452c9A0F075B606ee64087`, with a minimum stake requirement of 3 ETH, and a 7000 block unstaking period (23.3 minutes with 200ms mev-commit chain blocktime). This allows two L1 epochs (finalization period) plus a settlement buffer, to pass between validator unstake initiation and withdrawal.

The registry strictly accepts BLS public keys as the validator opt-in identifier. Any EOA can stake on behalf of a validator pub key, and only that EOA has the ability to withdraw in the future.

To `stake` with the contract, see the following function signature, where ether sent with the transaction is split evenly among the specified validator accounts:

```solidity
function stake(bytes[] calldata validatorBLSPubKeys) external payable {
    uint256 splitAmount = msg.value / validatorBLSPubKeys.length;
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < validatorBLSPubKeys.length; i++) {
        stakedBalances[validatorBLSPubKeys[i]] += splitAmount;
    }
}
```

### Golang example

We're working on a UI to stake with the validator registry. In the meantime you can programmatically interact with the registry via [golang scripts](https://github.com/primevprotocol/validator-registry).

For example, to stake any number of validator BLS public keys with the registry, use [this example script](https://github.com/primevprotocol/validator-registry/blob/main/cmd/stake/main.go) as described below.

First checkout the validator-registry repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/primevprotocol/validator-registry.git
```

Then cd into the repo and populate `keys_example.txt` with your validator BLS public keys.

```bash
cd validator-registry
vi keys_example.txt
*Edit file as needed*
```

Then navigate to the `cmd/stake` directory and run the script with the private key that was funded above.

```bash
cd cmd/stake
PRIVATE_KEY="0x..." go run main.go
```

Note this script will attempt to stake 3.1 ETH on behalf of each validator BLS public key in `keys_example.txt`.

## Withdrawing staked ether

If you wish to withdraw your staked ether, you can do so via the previously mentioned validator registry page, or using a golang script similar to what's provided. Note an unstaking period is enforced, meaning you must first submit an `unstake` transaction, wait an appropriate amount of blocks, then submit a `withdraw` transaction, transferring funds to your account.
