## Interacting with the Bidder Node

First, you can set the local environment variables to set your `KEY` and `ADDRESS`. Change directories to the one with your key (this should be the same folder as mev-commit). If you used the [Quickstart](/get-started/quickstart) command, your folder would be `$HOME/.mev-commit`.

Setting these will make running the commands to interact with your account easier.

```shell ‚ùØ_ terminal
export KEY=$(cat key)
export ADDRESS=$(cast wallet address --private-key 0x$(cat key))
```

## Getting Deposit

To get the current deposit balance in the contract:

```shell ‚ùØ_ terminal
curl -s http://localhost:13523/v1/bidder/get_deposit
```

üí°Deposit represents the funds in the bidder's account that can be used to submit bids on the mev-commit p2p-network and settled on-chain.

## Withdraw Deposited Funds

```shell ‚ùØ_ terminal
cast send 0xa86a41b57Fb73f9118F84847574517258d29eAD0 "withdrawBidderAmountFromWindow(address,uint256)" $ADDRESS $WINDOW_NUMBER \
--rpc-url https://chainrpc.testnet.mev-commit.xyz --private-key $KEY
```

## Checking the Balance of your Wallet

This command will allow you to check your current wallet balance on mev-commit chain:

```shell ‚ùØ_ terminal
cast b $ADDRESS --rpc-url https://chainrpc.testnet.mev-commit.xyz
```

## Check Total Value Locked in Contracts

```shell ‚ùØ_ terminal
python3 -c "print($(cast b 0xa86a41b57Fb73f9118F84847574517258d29eAD0 \
--rpc-url https://chainrpc.testnet.mev-commit.xyz) + $(cast b 0x5960774AD41D03DAB4916a30bD2190f8b3b3b4b2 \
--rpc-url https://chainrpc.testnet.mev-commit.xyz))"
```

## Topology

```shell ‚ùØ_ terminal
