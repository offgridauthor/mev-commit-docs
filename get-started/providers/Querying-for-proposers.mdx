The validator registry contract maintains a set of validators who are opted in to the mev-commit protocol. This is achieved by requiring those validators to stake ether with the registry on behalf of their BLS public key.

## Querying opted-in validators

Anyone can query the full list of validators pubkeys who have opted in to mev-commit by calling the `getNumberOfStakedValidators` function in conjunction with `getStakedValidators` on the validator registry contract. See the following signatures:

```solidity
/// @return numStakedValidators uint number of currently staked validators. 
/// @return stakedValsetVersion uint version of the staked valset at the time of query.
function getNumberOfStakedValidators() external view returns (uint256, uint256);

/// @dev Returns an array of staked validator BLS pubkeys within the specified range. Ordering is unspecified.
/// We require users to query in batches, with knowledge from getNumberOfStakedValidators().
///
/// @return set of staked validator BLS pubkeys.
/// @return stakedValsetVersion uint version of the staked valset at the time of query.
function getStakedValidators(uint256 start, uint256 end) external view returns (bytes[] memory, uint256);
```

`stakedValsetVersion` is updated on-chain anytime the set of opted-in validators changes. This returned value can be used for debugging and/or as an [optimistic locking](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/db2/11.5?topic=overview-optimistic-locking) mechanism to ensure the set of validators hasn't changed during a batch query.

That is, if all queries in a batch return the same `stakedValsetVersion`, the aggregate staked validator set is valid. Otherwise handling is left to the user (who will likely retry the batch query).

Note geth supports [batched RPC requests](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/interacting-with-geth/rpc/batch) which can be used to speed up this process.

### Golang example

You can programmatically query the validator registry via [golang scripts](https://github.com/primevprotocol/validator-registry).

For example, to query the full list of staked validators, use [this example script](https://github.com/primevprotocol/validator-registry/blob/main/cmd/query/main.go) as described below.

First checkout the validator-registry repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/primevprotocol/validator-registry.git
```

Then cd into the repo and run the query script:

```bash
cd validator-registry/cmd/query
go run main.go
```

This script can act as a starting point for integrating validator registry queries into your own tooling. The contract's go binding is available [here](https://github.com/primevprotocol/validator-registry/blob/main/pkg/validatorregistry/ValidatorRegistry.go).

## Upcoming Proposers

Due to L1 proposer selection being fixed two epochs in advance, bidders can foresee whether the proposer for an upcoming slot has opted-in to mev-commit. To query upcoming proposers from a beacon node, use the [getProposerDuties endpoint](https://ethereum.github.io/beacon-APIs/#/Validator/getProposerDuties). The returned proposer list can be cross-checked with a validator registry query to determine upcoming mev-commit opted-in proposers.

The mev-commit-oracle will streamline this process by updating a list on the validator registry contract with mev-commit opted-in validators for the latest two epochs.
